        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>Analytically driven, statistically minded, highly resilient problem-solver, proactively seeking to kickstart my career within data engineering. My inclination towards fixing things, optimising systems and solving puzzles has drawn me to data engineering, while my previous occupation as a proficient music educator grew my interpersonal skills for stakeholder communication. Through instrumental coaching I have cultivated a patient approach to new challenges and a creative, charismatic leadership style. I also have a strong social and global conscience which makes me excited to participate in the forward-thinking tech sector, contributing digital solutions to real-world problems. Since taking on data engineering full-time I have thoroughly enjoyed broadening my skill-set with Python, SQL and cloud programming.</p>
